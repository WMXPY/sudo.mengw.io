## No one likes garbled stuff

It is a common way to store data in a database with almost meaningless strings like UUID and ObjectID.

However, it is unfriendly to display meaningless strings to end users. For non-developers, we can display the main fields of data in other ways that are readable and also hard to repeat. Introducing `@sudoo/readable-identifier`.

## Generate Identifier

Install `@sudoo/readable-identifier` is easy, simply run the following command in your project folder.

```sh
yarn add @sudoo/readable-identifier
# Or
npm install @sudoo/readable-identifier --save
```
